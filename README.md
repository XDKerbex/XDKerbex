Hi my name is Sebastian Andrade
I'm currently a college student studying to get my bachelor's in psychology.
Coding was just a required class to graduate but I have grown a bit fond of this language (as hard as it may be).
So I am hoping to return to GitHub every once in a while just to browse around and keep my very little coding experience fresh/up to date in case ever need be.
